        <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
        <p>In my previous job working in email marketing I manipulated HTML & CSS specifically for emails. I also learnt about data cleansing and management.</p>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>Before I worked in email marketing I worked in customer service. I worked in various retail jobs, as well as head of operations at a start-up called Fastgardener. All these roles helped to develop my communication skills, as did other
          activities during my time at university, such as my year abroad in Japan.</p>
